### Presentation
Low-dose Radiation: A Problem or a Solution?

### Speaker
Mohan Doss, PhD, MCCPM

#### LNT Model

* Linear no-threshold
* First accepted by the National Academy of Sciences in 1956
* From a letter from a committee member at the time, viewed as "stretching a point," 
  and accepted because it would  increase the amount of money that would go to genetics research
* LNT Model has "questionable origin"

#### Low-dose Radiation (LDR)

* Adaptive response following low-dose radiation exposure
* Increased antioxidants, DNA repair enzymes, apoptosis
* This is known as adaptive protection
* Low dose radiation data shows overall _reduction_ in cancer risk in
  mice due to improved DNA repair

#### Cancer Risk

* Rises due to transplants and HIV/AIDS, possibly due to reduced
  immune system, _not_ genetic mutation
* Immune system response lowers with age, could _this_ be what is
  causing the increase in cancer risk?
* Populations that recieve LDR have _lower_ cancer death rates than
  the control, and much lower than would be expected by LNT
* Date isn't great, most effects are only on the order of one standard deviation.
