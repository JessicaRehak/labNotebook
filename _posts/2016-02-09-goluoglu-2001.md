##### Codes:
`TORT`: Three-dimensional, discrete ordinates code

`TDTORT`: time-dependent version of TORT

##### Assumptions:

* Energy spectrum of prompt neutrons and precurser groups are space
  independent

##### Notes:

* Quasi-static method is a flux synthesis method to solve the
  _time-dependent_ Boltzmann transport eq
* Time-dependent flux is product of slowly varying shape function
  (space/energy/angle) and rapidly varying amplitude function
* Factorization is unique because of a normalization condition
* Shape eq. is only solved when needed, amplitude function (simpler)
  is solved frequently over small time intervals
* Normalization condition looks like the one from Henry (1958)
* The shape equation is solved, the result is used to calculate
  parameters via inner prodcuts, then time-dependent ampl. and
  precurser eqs are solved with those inner products.
* Transport Eq is solved with `TORT`, time derivative is approximated
  by a backward difference approach
* Shape function is calculated by using the normalization condition
  from earlier, then the amplitude function is calculated by solving
  the kinetics eqs with the `LSODE` solver.
* _Transient 1:_ single step perturbation at time 0, cross sections
  are changed to simulate a step change in materials
* _Transient 2:_ step at time 0, second step added at a later time
* _Transient 3:_ step at time 0, followed by ramp starting at time 0
* _Transient 4:_ ramp starting at time 0
