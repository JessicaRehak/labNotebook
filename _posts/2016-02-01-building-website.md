Building the website:

* Established three categories: entry, paper, meeting
* Early use of tags will make searching even easier.
* Should consider adding a "talks" category too, are these even worth including here?
* I should probably just delete everything in the main branch

Things to look at adding in the future:

* Better CSS (when I have free time)
* git plugin, when I actually start contributing to any projects
